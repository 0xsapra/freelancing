Submitting: Implement the program in the proj2.c source file. Submit the source file through the information system. Translation: Translate the program with the following arguments: $ gcc -std = c99 -Wall -Wextra -Werror-proj2.c -lm -o proj2 Start and exit the program The input data of the program will be entered as its arguments:
$ ./proj2 U0 R EPS
Up = XXX V
Ip = YYYY A


where: U0 is the value of the input voltage in Volts, R is the resistance of the resistor in Ohms and EPS is absolute error / precision / deviation (epsilon), XXXX is the diode operating point voltage a YYYY is the diode operating point current value. The numeric output format XXXX and YYYY corresponds to the% g formatting tag.


Task 1 Express the last equation using U_p, U_0 and R. 2. task Implement an algorithm scheme for calculating the sequence using the bisection method. The terminating condition will correspond to the absolute required precision of the result (epsilon). 3. task Write a diode function that looks for the voltage value U_p using the diagram from the 2nd subtask and the formula from the 1st subtask. The initial voltage interval will be from 0 to U_0. double diode (double u0, double r, double eps); In the function u0 is the value of the input voltage, r is the resistance of the resistor and eps is the absolute accuracy (maximum required deviation). The function in return value returns the found voltage U_p.
